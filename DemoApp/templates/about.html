                    <p>
                        The Stroke Risk Prediction project is dedicated to making stroke risk assessment accessible to
                        everyone. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data from trusted medical
                        research, we’ve developed a tool that helps individuals understand their risk of experiencing a
                        stroke within the next 10 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stroke remains one of the leading causes of disability and death globally. Early identification
                        of risk factors and timely prevention are critical in reducing stroke-related complications. Our
                        tool empowers individuals to evaluate their personal risk and take proactive steps toward
                        protecting their brain and overall vascular health.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">The Dataset we choose</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kaggle hosts several stroke-related datasets that are widely used in healthcare research and
                        machine learning projects. One of the most popular is the Stroke Prediction Dataset, which
                        includes medical and demographic information such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease,
                        glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This dataset is designed to help build predictive
                        models to identify individuals at risk of stroke. Its clean structure and labeled outcomes make
                        it ideal for classification tasks, exploratory data analysis, and developing early-warning
                        systems in digital health applications. Researchers and developers use this data to gain
                        insights into key risk factors and improve clinical decision-making.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Our Methodology</h2>
                    <p>
                        We've implemented multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze the real collected
                        data and create risk prediction models. These include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong>: A supervised learning algorithm that finds
                            the optimal hyperplane to separate data into different classes with the maximum margin.</li>
                        <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</strong>: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that
                            classifies data based on the majority label of its ‘k’ nearest neighbors in the feature
                            space.</li>
                        <li><strong>Artificial Neural Network (ANN)</strong>: A computational model inspired by the
                            human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that learn complex patterns
                            through training.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decision Tree</strong>: A tree-structured model used for classification or
                            regression, where decisions are made by splitting data into subsets based on feature values.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        By comparing the results from these different algorithms, we can provide a more robust and
                        accurate prediction of heart disease risk.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4">Risk Factors We Consider</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our prediction model takes into account the following risk factors, all of which have been shown
                        to be significant predictors of stroke:

                    <p>
                        While our stroke prediction model is built on validated data and modern machine learning
                        techniques, several limitations should be considered:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dataset used, such as the popular Stroke Prediction Dataset on Kaggle, may not fully
                            represent all ethnicities, age groups, or socioeconomic backgrounds, potentially affecting
                            generalizability.</li>
                        <li>Our tool provides a probabilistic risk estimate—not a medical diagnosis—and should not
                            replace professional evaluation..</li>
                        <li>It is intended to support awareness and early prevention efforts, not serve as a standalone
                            clinical tool..</li>
                        <li>Additionally, some individual risk factors—such as family history, rare medical conditions,
                            or genetic markers—may not be fully accounted for in the current model.
